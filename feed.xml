<ul>
  <li>use the data generated from physics model. This is the least involved level, where the model equations are only used as a source to generate data for supervised training.</li>
  <li>use soft constraints in the form of physics based loss term. This is where approaches like PINN belong.</li>
  <li>use differentiable physics simulator. This is the tightest coupling currently, where the network weights are updated with the gradients calculated from an integrated simulator.</li>
</ul>

<p>In human motion related problems, supervised training with real data dominates. Simulated data are not as popular because of the complexity and multimodality of human movement. However, we still can find some works that are close to this approach, such as PhysDiff<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>, which provides physics denoised data for the diffusion process by pushing the intermediate results through a physics simulator.</p>

<p>The second approach is not usually utilized the same way as in PINN, because the PDE describing human motion includes discrete contact terms that are difficult to get gradients from. 
However, intuitive physics loss terms such as simple stability and ground constraints are getting more attention, for example IPMAN<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. Another slightly related example is InterDiff<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>, where the trajectories of the interacting objects are kept simple by transformation to appropriate frames.</p>

<p>One work that uses the final approach is <strong>Weakly supervised learning of human dynamics</strong><sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>. The paper did not incorporate a physics simulator, instead it used simple forward dynamics calculations supplied with prediction of contact information (which is also the approach of DnD<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>). It would be interesting to check if SIP training would improve its performance. Probably likewise for DnD, however the training time could be prohibitive. Another paper much closer to the spirit of the final approach is DiffPhy<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup>, where TDS is used in the reconstruction loop.</p>

    Simple HumanML3D word cloud from 29232 files, including the mirrored actions. We removed a lot of positional and directional words to make the actions stand out more. It seems we have a lot of walking action here.

<p>Then I realized I didn’t need to do this - I should be able to get all the verbs from the helpful markers that I discarded the first time round</p>

<p>At this point we can probably get something a little more concrete by counting the number of verbs and how many times each word appears. We ended up with 1671 unique verbs, the top ten are</p>

<p>As we have noted before the walking action is quite dominant. Verbs with low count included quite a lot of misspelt words as well as possibly mistagged words such as ‘rotatibg’, ‘leftwhilst’, etc.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="random" /><category term="motion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was curious about the actions in HumanML3D, so I made a simple word cloud out of the descriptions.
